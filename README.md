## 🎮 How It Works

1. She'll see the question: "Will you be my Valentine? 🌹"
2. Two buttons appear: "YES! 💕" and "No"
3. If she clicks "No":
   - The button text changes to something funny
   - After multiple clicks, the button starts shrinking
   - Eventually, the "No" option disappears completely!
4. When she clicks "YES!":
   - Balloons fall from the top
   - A celebration message appears
   - Success! 🎉
